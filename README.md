# POSTIZ

Postiz is an innovative platform designed to streamline content posting and management, offering a user-friendly experience for creators and businesses.
The website features an intuitive interface for managing posts, scheduling, and real-time analytics to optimize your online presence.

### Dependencies
This project is built entirely from scratch, leveraging only the essential dependencies to ensure a lightweight and efficient application:
- React and React DOM to create and display the user interface.
- React Router DOM to handle navigation between pages.
- React Icons to add icons to the site.
- clsx and tailwind-merge to manage and combine CSS classes.
- html-react-parser to safely display HTML content.

These tools were chosen to keep the project efficient.
